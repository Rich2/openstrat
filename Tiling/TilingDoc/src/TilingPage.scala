  | game Diplomacy the grand strategy Paradox Interactive game series Victoria, Europa Universals and Hearts of Iron, or the classic board game Risk,
  | which has become popular in its online form.Irregular tiles provides great flexibility when representing geography from the real world, allowing
  | the game designer to greatly exaggerate the features and boundaries, they want and to downplay and ignore the features and boundaries they
  | consider less important or distracting. The two dominant regular tiling systems are standard squares and hexs. Tranlge while useful as a graphics
  | primitive is not useful for strategy games. It is also possible to tile with squares where alternative rows or alternate columns are
  | offset.""".stripMargin)

  val p2 = HtmlP("""But from here on I'm only going to consider the standard square tiling and hex tiling. We'll focus on the hex grid system first
  | but a lot of what I say will apply to hex and square tile grid. Now with hex tiling we have a choice between nice continuous rows and nice
  | continuous columns. without too much ado I have chosen to keep rows over columns. We write in rows not colunms and this means on real world hex
  | maps our hex rows can follow lines of latitude, right around the earth if necessary, where as if you want to go north or south you have to zigzag.
  | We'll assign tiles some row and column integer coordinates. Straightforward for the squares, the only diference with the hexs is that when I move
  | right I increase by 2 column units. If I go up-right I go up 1 row and right 1 column. If I then go down-right I down 1 and right anther column
  | giving the same result of same row coordinate but column increased by 2. """.stripMargin)

  val p3 = HtmlP("""So things are still pretty simple right? A hex is either land or its water. A hex is either hilly or or its not. If we were
  | creating some kind of low level Dungeons and Dragons type game a square could be either be rock which you can not enter of the open space of a
  | room or a cavern which you can enter. Unfortunately this is not going to work at least for real world maps. So I have mapped Britain at a number
  | of scales including 80km hex tiles. At this scale mainland Britain occupies 15 hex rows from Cornwall to the north of Scotland. However the
  | English Channel, or La Manche at its narrowest point still does not occupy a full hex at this scale.""".stripMargin)
