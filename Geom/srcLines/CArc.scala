/** Circular arc. Has a rotation counter to allow rotation deltas greater than 360 degrees and less than - 360 degrees. The CArc is intended to function as
 * closely as possible to the functioning of CArcTails in a curve path. Hence, the decision to store the three points as fields rather using the [[AngleVec]] of
 * the arc which would allow less data. This is to avoid calculation / rounding errors in the start and end points, which will be used by other [[CurveSeg]]s in
 * curve paths.
