/* These lessons are intended to be accessible to people who haven't programmed before and have limited geometry knowledge. This is a comment. It
 *  doesn't do anything. Everything between the forward-slash star at the beginning of the comment and the star forward-slash at the end is a comment.
 *  Hopefully in your
 *   editor or IDE (integrated Developer Environment) the comments will appear in a different colour. */

// This is also a comment. Everything after two forward-slashes to the end of line. You can add and remove //s from the beginning of the commands,
// Assuming you are running the "mill -w name.runBackground" when you do a save mill will automatically rebuild and you can see the result of your changes.
// The associated commands will appear / disappear from the screen.

/** There are three types of values above. Numbers, text and Colours. Try changing the numbers, save the file and you should things move around the screen.
 * Congratulations! you are now a programmer. But, but, you respond, there's loads of magic going on here that I don't understand. All programmers rely on
 * magic, and of course the first thing we should know about magic is it doesn't always work. I will try and explain how some of the magic works, but in
 * programming there's always more magic to decode.
 *
 * The second type is text. Programmers refer to text as Strings, for some reason. I shall use the term string from now on. Strings start with a " quotation
 * mark and end with a quotation mark. Change the text in on one of the strings, save the file, and you should see the text change on the screen. If you try
 * replacing a string with a number or replacing a number with a String, the compiler will complain, and you will get an error message. The third type is Colour.
 * Note Colours must have the correct capital letters. You can just try guessing the colours or you can google / duckduck web colours to see what is available.
 * Again put a Colour where a number or a string is expected or vice versa and the compiler will complain. */
