	This package and module is for Earth maps. In particular the tiling of the whole world in Hex grids, defining the changes
   over the course of history. This will be a data orientated module. It will also include terrain types to model terrain, both real and imagined for
   local maps and higher scales right up to 0.5 metres per tile However it won't generally include the data for these. The data for the real world
   will be organised according to a number of levels, which are likely to change over increasingly shorter historical time frames.
