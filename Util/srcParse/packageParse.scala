/** This is the RSON package. Readable Succinct Object Notation. It could be just as accurately be described as Readable Succinct Data Notation, but that
 * wouldn't scan as well and indicate it as a better replacement for JSON. RSON uses the standard semicolon separated statements combined with multilevel
 * bracket hierarchy syntax familiar from C, C++, Java and JavaScript. Its main innovations over JSON and XML are allowing statements to be partitioned into
 * comma delineated clauses, the empty statement, the empty clause and type inference. It uses a context free operator precedence hierarchy, with the exception
 * of allowing the 4 ( - + ~ !) operator to be used as prefix operators. Beyond this it generally follows Scala syntax where this doesn't conflict with the
 * preceding rules. Unlike Scala statements must finish with a semicolon unless it is the last statement of a file or a bracket block. Allowing statements to
 * end with a newline introduces horrendous ambiguities unless one is willing to go completely down the significant whitespace route, and I'm not sure if that
 * could work even work for such a general purpose basic syntax.
 *  
 *  The above allows it to combine a high level of human readability, succinctness, non-programmer / non-expert write-ability, programmer flexibility and
 *  composability and fast-parsing. The initial motivating use case was strategy games, which require huge amounts of modable date files. XML and JSON, the
 *  current defaults are simply not fit for purpose. RSON aims to break down the walls between game player, game modder, professional game artist, professional
 *  game scripter, professional imperative programming wizards in languages such as C / C++ and Rust and professional functional programming wizards in
 *  languages such as Scala, Haskell and Idris. */
